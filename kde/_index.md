# Desktop (XFCE)

A lightweight desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems.
It aims to be fast and low on system resources while being visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Installing applications

In this configuration, XFCE is set up to use **Flatpak in user mode**.  
Flatpak is a software utility for software
deployment, package management, and application virtualization for Linux. By using Flatpak in user mode, users can
install and manage applications from the Flatpak store without needing administrative privileges or modifying the base
Docker image.  
This setup enhances flexibility and security, as users can add or remove applications independently of the
underlying system.
